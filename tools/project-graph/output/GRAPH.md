## How to query this graph

```bash
pnpm graph                                  # regenerate
node tools/project-graph/query.mjs <path>   # impact of changing a file
```

`output/index.json` is the machine-readable source of truth. For any file it
records `dependsOn`, `dependedOnBy`, `coveredByTests`, and its owning
workspace/module — read that instead of crawling the repository.
